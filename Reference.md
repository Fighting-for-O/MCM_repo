> The fungi are traditionally considered [heterotrophs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heterotroph), organisms that rely solely on [carbon fixed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fixation) by other organisms for [metabolism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism). Fungi have [evolved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution) a high degree of metabolic versatility that allows them to use a diverse range of organic substrates for growth, including simple compounds such as [nitrate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nitrate), [ammonia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ammonia), [acetate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acetate), or [ethanol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethanol).[[74\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus#cite_note-Marzluf1981-74)[[75\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus#cite_note-Heynes1994-75) In some species the pigment [melanin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melanin) may play a role in extracting energy from [ionizing radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation), such as [gamma radiation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_rays). This form of ["radiotrophic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiotrophic_fungus) growth has been described for only a few species, the effects on growth rates are small, and the underlying [biophysical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biophysics) and biochemical processes are not well known.[[37\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus#cite_note-Dadachova2007-37) This process might bear similarity to [CO2 fixation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_fixation) via [visible light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visible_spectrum), but instead uses ionizing radiation as a source of energy.[[76\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fungus#cite_note-Dadachova2008-76)

### 真菌的繁殖方式

**高等真菌的营养繁殖与无性繁殖**：

+ 典型的高等真菌兼具有性和无性繁殖。通常很多真菌的**有性繁殖在一年中仅仅产生一次**;而无性繁殖因产生的个体较多,特别是因无性循环在一个季节中常常重复多次,所以营养繁殖在高等真菌种的繁衍传播上起着更为重要的作用.高等真菌的营养繁殖可概括为体细胞的段裂,体细胞分裂成子细胞,体细胞的芽殖等三种类型;以及无性的抱子繁殖又有各种形态的抱子。

+ > And while the number of spores produced by microscopic fungi are not of this magnitude, they are nevertheless still significant in the numbers that are produced. *[Rhizopus stolonifer](http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/wong/BOT135/Rhizopus_sporangia.GIF)*, the common bread mold, can be recognized by the grayish, aerial mycelium covered with numerous black "dots". These dots are the sporangia containing spores of this fungus. Each sporangium contains upwards of 50,000 spores. A single spore grown from this species, in three to four days, will produce hundreds of millions of spores. Many species of microscopic fungi are capable of producing comparable number of spores.

  并且尽管由微观真菌产生的孢子数量不是这个数量级，但是它们在产生的数量上仍然是重要的。 常见的面包发霉-*[根霉（Rhizopus stolonifer）](http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/faculty/wong/BOT135/Rhizopus_sporangia.GIF)*，可以被覆盖有许多黑色“点”的浅灰色的气生菌丝体识别。这些点是含有这种真菌孢子的孢子囊。每个孢子囊含有50,000孢子以上。从该物种中生长出的单个孢子，将在三到四天内产生数亿个孢子。许多种类的微观真菌能够产生相当数量的孢子。

+ 通过水传播

  > Where wind dispersed spores are hydrophobic, water dispersed readily absorb water and are said to be **hydrophilic**. Water dispersed spores often produce their spores in "slime". Due to the weight of the slime and the fact that the slime masses the spores together, wind dispersal is impossible or at least impractical. What occurs in these spores is that when large amounts of water is present, during a rain or in area where there is water flowing freely, such as in a stream, the spores are carried away, passively. The spores are characteristically shaped, usually with long appendages or are coiled (Figure 9). The spores stay afloat due to the surface tension of the spore or air pockets in the spores. The major source of food for these fungi are from leaf litter and other plant material that may fall into streams.
